Fire Detection _ People Counting + Sending Emergency SOS üî• üÜò 

Project Scope: 
> 1Ô∏è‚É£  The project's goal is to detect the fire in the shop/warehouse early on, avoiding a major catastrophe, using tweaked HSV values for greater accuracy. Once the fire is detected, an alarm will be activated instantly, followed by emergency notifications with the number of people trapped inside.

> 2Ô∏è‚É£  Corresponding recipients, such as business owners, CEOs, and nearby fire stations, will be notified via WhatsApp and email with the number of people inside the shop, along with email attachments such as a snap of the fire and its fire-threshold masked image to avoid false positives, and the shop's coordinates on a map for quick rescue service.
